# Base app for discord.js (This README and project is WIP)

This projects is a made using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). It is used as a base app and includes a couple of handy features

# Features

- Easier command creation.
- Automatic command registering - all command files are registered to the Discord API.
- Interaction handling - each interaction from Discord gets mapped to the correct command.

## Command creation

Command files are file which ends in `.job.ts` and define one command. All of these files are imported automatically. Here is a [music app](https://github.com/smultronbusken/discord-music-app) of mine. As you can see we have 5 command files under the command folder.

This is the code for the slash command `skip.job.ts`

```typescript
import { SlashCommand } from "@smultronbusken/skeleton-discord-app/src/Jobs";
import SongApp from "../main";

export default new SlashCommand<SongApp>({
  name: "skip",
  info: "Skips the current song.",
  execute(interaction, app) {
    let subscription = app.getSubscription(interaction.guildId);
    if (subscription) {
      let nextSong = subscription.queue.dequeue();
      if (nextSong) {
        subscription.playSong(nextSong);
        interaction.reply(`ðŸŽ¶ Now playing **${nextSong.title}**`);
      }
    }
  },
});
```

### Types of commands

There are 4 types of commands of which all are registered automatically:

## Set up

1. Install with `npm i base-app-for-discordjs`
2. Install discord.js (^14.11.0) and stormdb (^0.6.0) `npm i stormdb` `npm i discord.js`  
3. Run a file with the following code:

```typescript
    // Create a client and login as normal using Discord.js
    const client = new Client(clientOptions);
    client.login(config["APP_TOKEN"]);

    // Create the object
    const skeleton = new Skeleton();

    // Set what will be passed to commands when executed
    skeleton.setContext({})

    // Manually add a command, instead of writing it in a .job.ts file
    skeleton.addCommand(new SlashCommand<{}>({
        info: "Lmao",
        name: "manuallyadded",
        async execute(interaction, context) { 
            interaction.reply("Looking good bro")
        }
    }))

    // Loads all .job.ts files and registers them.
    skeleton.run({
      appId:  config["APP_ID"],
      client: client,
      token: config["APP_TOKEN"],
      guildId: config["DEV_GUILD_ID"]
    })
```
