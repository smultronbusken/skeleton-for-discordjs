# Base app for discord.js (This README and project is WIP)

This projects is a made using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). It is used as a base app and includes a couple of handy features

# Features

- Easier command creation.
- Automatic command registering - all command files are registered to the Discord API.
- Interaction handling - each interaction from Discord gets mapped to the correct command.

## Command creation

Command files are file which ends in `.job.ts` and define one command. All of these files are imported automatically. Here is a [music app](https://github.com/smultronbusken/discord-music-app) of mine. As you can see we have 5 command files under the command folder.

This is the code for the slash command `skip.job.ts`

```typescript
import { SlashCommand } from "@smultronbusken/skeleton-discord-app/src/Jobs";
import SongApp from "../main";

export default new SlashCommand<SongApp>({
  name: "skip",
  info: "Skips the current song.",
  execute(interaction, app) {
    let subscription = app.getSubscription(interaction.guildId);
    if (subscription) {
      let nextSong = subscription.queue.dequeue();
      if (nextSong) {
        subscription.playSong(nextSong);
        interaction.reply(`ðŸŽ¶ Now playing **${nextSong.title}**`);
      }
    }
  },
});
```

### Types of commands

## Set up

1. Install with `npm i base-app-for-discordjs`
2. Install discord.js (^14.11.0) and stormdb (^0.6.0) `npm i stormdb` `npm i discord.js`  
3. Run a file with the following code:

```typescript
  import Skeleton from "base-app-for-discordjs"

    const intents = { intents: [...all intents you need] }
    const skeleton = new Skeleton(
      {}, // This object will get passed to commands, it can be anything
      "APP_TOKEN",  // You get this from the Discord developer portal
      "APP_ID", // You get this from the Discord developer portal
      intents,
      "ID_OF_A_GUILD_WHERE_YOU_TEST_YOUR_COMMANDS" // this is optional, but without it it takes up to an hour to register commands
    );
    skeleton.client.login("APP_TOKEN");
  })
```
